# Room Homepage

A responsive, multi-section landing page with an interactive content carousel and mobile navigation.

## Description

This project is a solution to the "Room homepage" challenge from Frontend Mentor. The main goal was to build a modern, multi-section landing page with a minimalist design and key interactive features. This project is an excellent example of combining clean **HTML** and elegant **CSS** with essential **JavaScript** to create dynamic content. The two main functionalities built with JavaScript are a responsive content carousel in the hero section and a mobile navigation menu.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For creating the semantic structure of the page, including the header, main content sections, and the footer.
* **CSS3:** For all the styling, including typography, colors, responsive design, and transitions for the mobile menu.
* **JavaScript:** This is the core technology used to handle the interactivity of the page. It manages:
    * The **content carousel**, which changes the image, title, and description based on user clicks.
    * The **mobile navigation menu**, which toggles a full-screen menu overlay when the hamburger icon is clicked.

## Usage

This project serves as a showcase of a professional and functional landing page. It features a hero section with a dynamic slider, a section with an image and an "About" text, and a final section with two decorative images. The responsive design ensures a great user experience on all devices.

## Features

* **Dynamic Content Carousel:** The hero section includes a carousel that allows the user to click through different product images and descriptions.
* **Responsive Navigation:** The main menu transforms into a hamburger menu on smaller screens, handled by JavaScript.
* **Multi-Section Layout:** The page is structured into distinct, well-defined sections.
